/**
 * A screen for authenticating a user. It displays a form for the user to enter their email and

 * The purpose of this screen is to group into a single component what is common to the login and
 * registration screens.
 *
 * @param action The text to be displayed on the action button.
 * @param state The current state of the authentication process.
 * @param onAuthenticate The callback to be invoked when the user clicks the action button. It
 *   receives the user's email and password as parameters.
